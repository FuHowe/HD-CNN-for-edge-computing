We update the code and upload experimental result files.


This is an open-source code for "Running Unmodified CNN with low RAM on Resources-Constrained MCU for WSN Edge Computing"

The project can be compiled and run directly on the STM32H723 chip, as well as on the STM32F103 chip, provided that you establish the corresponding project and port the code.

The code provides core examples of edge computing rather than the entire WSN collection and processing program, as the collection code involves some commercial secrets.

Since the collection code cannot be disclosed, data collection in this code is read from Flash, or you can construct your own data collection.
